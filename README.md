# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
        it ensures customer satisfaction,prevents cost overrun,and maintain a competititve edge.project managers can meet deadline
        by setting clear milestone,using project management tolls,regularaly reviewing progress,and managing risks effectively.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
         it ensures efficient resource allocation,prevents financial waste ,and keep the project on track.strategies to prevent overrun
         include detailed budgeting,continuous monitoring,risk assesment,adjusting scope when necesssary and using cost estimation
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
          AGILE:Iterative,flexible,customer-centric.PROS-Rapid feedback adaptability,continuous improvements.CONS-harder to estimate costs,requires active
                customer involvement
          WATERFALL:sequential,structured,documentation-heavy.  PROS-clear planning.predictable tmelines.CONS-inflexible,late-stage issues costly to fix    
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
          AGILE-suitsdynamic projects with evolving requirements ,such as startup developing mobile apps
          WATERFALL-is best for well-defined projects,such as government software systems or banking application requiring strict compliance
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
          automated testing,code reviews,continuous intergration,user feedback,and debugging,High standards ensure reliability,security,and user satisfaction while reducing post
          -release fixes
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
